## ABOUT

A funny, simple webapp for saving your favorite Matt Damon movies.

### CSS/JS

This app is my first attempt at truly using bootstrap's css/js files well. You'll find decent styling and the use of js to display progress.

Bootstrap is used via actual files and not a gem.

## Installation / Setup

Clone repo locally. Install gems:

    bundle install

Set up database. We are using sqlite3.

    rake db:create db:migrate

Run your local server.
